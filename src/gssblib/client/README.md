# GSSB AngularJS App

## Modules

For now, we use a single `library` module, but every subdirectory could (and
probably should) define its own module.

## Routes

* `/item`: item search, selection of item with typeahead
* `/item/:barcode`: read view of an item
* `/borrower`: borrower entry point, selection of borrower with typeahead
* `/borrower/:number`: read view of a borrower
